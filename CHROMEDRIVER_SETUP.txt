# Selenium ChromeDriver setup instructions

To use Selenium with Chrome in your project, you need to download the ChromeDriver executable that matches your installed version of Google Chrome.

## Steps:

1. **Check your Chrome version:**
   - Open Chrome and go to `chrome://settings/help` to see your version.

2. **Download ChromeDriver:**
   - Go to: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
   - Download the version that matches your Chrome browser.

3. **Extract and place chromedriver.exe:**
   - Extract the downloaded file.
   - Place `chromedriver.exe` in your project root, or add its folder to your system PATH.

4. **(Optional) Specify path in code:**
   - If not in PATH, update your code:
     ```python
     driver = webdriver.Chrome(executable_path='path/to/chromedriver', options=chrome_options)
     ```

5. **Run your script!**
